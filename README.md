# smartparkk
The Smart Parking project by a team of three members revamps parking with IoT, Arduino, Google Firebase, and a website. IoT devices detect parking space availability and update to a central server, and Google Firebase stores data. The website displays real-time availability to  reduces search time, and optimizes parking space utilization.
